Welcome to my website's repo!

To build this project, I used the Gatsby-Netlify starter project which I modified
to fit my needs. I am fairly new to working with Gatsby, though I enjoy it's way of 
integrating with a CMS to write and publish articles in Markdown, instead of having to 
code all the structure for every new page. At the moment, I have been editing the Markdown
files directly in my editor, but I am planning on integrating Netlify to make it even easier
to create new blog posts. 

I used most of the pre-built code, in a first approach changing the lettering of the 
existing components. 
Then I copied certain components to build more pages with similar functionality and aspect.
The original example codebase uses Bulma for styling, but as I am rather fond of Sass, I am
surely going to delete the Bulma styles and write all in Sass. For this, I currently have 
one main stylesheet - although in the future this should probably be broken down into 
several logical parts, or sheets rather. 

This project (as well as my coding skills) are still in its infancy and are bound to have 
some kind of errors - if you spot one, I would really appreciate you reaching out to me and
making me aware of it (and helping me fix it if you are interested ;) ). Also if you have 
any other feedback, please let me know!
