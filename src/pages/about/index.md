I am a Junior FullStack Developer very eager to grow in the IT world.   
Sociable y empathetic, always looking for win-win solutions
and with a lot of interest and energy towards discovering and
adapting to new things. I am passionate about technology and
self-studying blockchain ecosystem and development.

### Background
After graduating Middle School in Germany and spending some time
near MÃ¡laga as an Au-Pair (living with a family supervising their children) I 
set out for a career in foreign languages, studying Spanish, English and
German and translating/interpreting between these languages. 

Having finished the training with great success, I returned to Spain in the 
mindset of increasing my language skills - a goal that has been very successful
and which led to my decision of staying here permanently in Barcelona, one of my
favourite cities.

Using my great communication skills and the three languages I speak fluently, 
I worked in Customer Service and Marketing, attending to telephone calls, emails
and support chats. I enjoyed working in very diverse and multilingual teams, caring
for customers and solving any inquiries about the company, products, orders or payments.

### My entrance into Tech
In late 2017, when Bitcoin reached its first big boom and the awareness of blockchain 
entered as a huge wave, and numerous Altcoins started popping up around the globe, each
claiming to have a different, new way of implementing the technology and specific utilities
of the coin, I was fascinated! 

Spending hours and hours of research about blockchain and cryptocurrency, I became more
and more interested in the underlying technology, scripts and data that make all this 
possible. Being able to create, maintain, troubleshoot and improve tools that may be used by
millions of people around the globe is something I find very exciting, and
rewarding. This is how I found my passion for coding!
