  description: >
    I am a Junior FullStack Web Developer with a
    strong passion for technology and the digital world, and excited about building modern web 
    applications and tools that make peopleâ€™s work
    and life easier. Creating, investigating and 
    trying new things are areas in which I thrive,
    and I enjoy passing this motivation to the ones around me.

        FrontEnd development is my main skill, where I am able to use my creativity to build appealing and accessible user interfaces. For this, I mainly use JavaScript with its modern React library, though I am keen on trying other frameworks and libraries. I am familiar with Responsive Design, styling tools such as Bootstrap and Tailwind, and UX/UI principles.

        I am also acquainted with the development of backend APIs, basic CRUD functions and the creation of simple databases. I learnt backend with Java, using the Spring framework to facilitate building and creating several team projects such as a movie inventory or a trip booking site. I enjoyed a brief experience with PHP + Laravel as part of a hackathon.
